#This is for the messages between the server and client
#SET UP FOR TASK 1.4

#What does the client recieve? -------------
RESULT = "RESULT HIT/MISS"
BOARD = "send updated board"

#client sends
FIRE = "FIRE B5"
PLACE = "PLACE A1 H BATTLESHIP"


#SERVER SIDE #sends
RESULT




line = 'B5'

if input (a,1) >> FIRE server 

#example of how the server would send a message to the client
if line.startswith("RESULT"):
    print(f"Shot result: {line.split()[1]}")  # "MISS" or "HIT"


#TODO
- check in firing or placing
    - get the game to send out some variable that can be checked

- hit and miss detection
    - also needs a result from the game somehow

- tie it all together.
